For ubuntu

This method is somewhat based on http://archive.fabacademy.org/2018/labs/fablabulb/students/nicolas-decoster/?page=assignment&assignment=13 

Find MCP2221 I2C bus driver v0.1 (that was a version included in another project i found)

Follow the documentation how to compile the driver and install it.

sudo i2cdetect -l

mine popped up at adress i2c-7

sudo i2cdetect -y 7 

to check what adress is the display at


I,ve disabled the backlight in the config I need to figure out why it doesn't light up when I use Backlight = Yes
